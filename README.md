# About 
- The project intends to diagnose the pneumonia from the xray image of the patients of ages 1 to 5 years
- Using X-rays, pneumonia can be detected even before symptoms become visible. This is often the case  in children between the ages of 1 and 4  is this wrong [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525772/)
- Diagnosing pneumonia in young children is fairly difficult, even for experienced doctors. Their symptoms can be misleading. this model can provide a fast, objective, and reliable piece of evidence to support a doctor's judgment, helping them see through the ambiguity.
- By focusing on the under-5 age group, This model targets the population where pneumonia is most deadly and where rapid diagnosis can have the most impact. Tool can serve as an assistant, helping doctors confirm their suspicions quickly and confidently.
- One Fact : ** Pneumonia accounts for 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years old, killing 740 180 children in 2019 **
